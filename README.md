# Arduino-Dark-Theme

Download the ZIP file, extract the `ZIP` file from whatever place you saved the downloads, and open the folder. Navigate to the theme folder, and right click, select "`copy`", and close the window. Open a new window, go to the Arduino IDE software. Right click on Show Package Contents, and click on Contents > Java > lib, rename the old theme as "theme v1.0" and paste the new `theme` folder. Restart your IDE, and you should be good to go.
